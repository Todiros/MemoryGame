# Memory Game

### Small card game that will test your memory. 
#### Project part of [Udacity's FEND](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). 

## How To Play  
---

The player has a board with 8 pairs of cards, for a total of 16 randomly ordered cards. The goal of the game is to match each pair with less than 19 attempts (moves). The stars represent the remaining moves. Each star equals 6 moves. When you run out of stars (moves) before matching every pair, the game is over and you lose. If you match all of the 8 pairs, you win. 

Above the board you will see a timer set to 00:00. It will initiate once you click the first card. The timer will disappear after 10 second but it will continue to count. You can see the elapsed time by hovering over it. 

Once the game is over, regardless of whether you win or lose, a modal will appear with information about the moves you took, remaining stars and elapsed time. You'll also see a button that will allow you restart the game. You can also close the modal with the 'X' on the top right corner to see your play.

Above the board on the right you will also see an arrow. This is a restart button that will refresh the board, timer and moves, and reorder the cards.
